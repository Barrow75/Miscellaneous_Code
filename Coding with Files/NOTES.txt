--- ENCODING UTF-8

> UTF-8:
    - Unicode Transformation Format 8 bit
    - A character encoding standard that uses one to four bytes to represent any Unicode code point, making it the most compatible with ASCII.
    - How it works:
          - Code points from 0 to 127 which corresponds to ASCII characters and are represented by using bytes; other characters require two, three, or four bytes
    - Importance:
          - Allows for the display of text in various laguages and scripts

  In Coding:
         ~ With the encoding='utf-8':

          with open("file.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
          > Ensures the file is written using UTF-8 encoding
          > Avoids encoding related errors when working with special characters such as emojis, non English text and accents
          > Ensures compatibility across different operating systems
          > With the UTF-8 it saves the file correctly so if it is opened in a different editor/ OS then there are no issues
          >
          >
